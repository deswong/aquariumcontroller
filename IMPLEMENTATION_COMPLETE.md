# Implementation Complete: Advanced Features

## Summary

All requested enhancements have been successfully implemented:

### ✅ 1. Dosing Pump Status in MQTT Payload
**Location**: `src/SystemTasks.cpp` - mqttTask()

Added comprehensive dosing pump state to MQTT JSON:
- Pump state (IDLE, DOSING, PAUSED, etc.)
- Progress, volumes, speed
- Schedule information
- Daily volume tracking

### ✅ 2. Configuration Persistence  
**Status**: Already fully implemented

All customizable values persist across restarts:
- **System Config**: WiFi, MQTT, NTP, Control, Pins (22 fields) → NVS
- **PID Parameters**: Kp, Ki, Kd, Target → Saved on adaptation
- **Dosing Pump**: Calibration, schedule, history → NVS
- **Water Change History**: 20 events → NVS

**Key Enhancement**: Added `saveParameters()` call in `AdaptivePID::adaptParameters()` so learned PID values persist immediately.

### ✅ 3. Self-Learning Water Change Prediction
**New Files**: 
- `include/WaterChangePredictor.h`
- `src/WaterChangePredictor.cpp`

**Algorithm**:
1. Tracks TDS before/after each water change
2. Calculates TDS increase rate using linear regression
3. Predicts days until TDS reaches threshold
4. Provides 10-95% confidence based on data consistency
5. Stores last 20 water change events in NVS

**Integration**:
- Auto-tracks water changes via WaterChangeAssistant
- Updates TDS every second in sensor task
- Recalculates prediction every hour
- Exposed in MQTT JSON payload

## Water Change Prediction Algorithm

### Mathematical Model
```
TDS(t) = TDS_after_change + (rate × t)

Prediction:
  days_until_change = (TDS_threshold - TDS_current) / rate
  
Where:
  - rate = learned TDS increase rate (ppm/day)
  - TDS_threshold = configurable (default: 400 ppm)
```

### Learning Process
1. **Data Collection**: Captures TDS before/after each water change + days between changes
2. **Linear Regression**: Calculates slope from historical data points
3. **Confidence**: Based on variance (consistent data = high confidence)
4. **Bounds**: Rate constrained to 0.5-50 ppm/day, prediction to 0-90 days

### Confidence Levels
- **90-95%**: Very high - consistent patterns
- **70-89%**: High - reliable patterns  
- **50-69%**: Moderate - some variance
- **30-49%**: Low - high variance
- **10-29%**: Very low - insufficient data
